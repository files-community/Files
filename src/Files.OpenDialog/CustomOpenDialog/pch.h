// Abstract:
//  This is a precompiled header file.

// Note:
//  The files listed below are compiled only once, which improves performance for subsequent compilations.
//  This setting also affects the performance of IntelliSense, including code completion and many other code browsing features.
//  However, the files listed here are ALL recompiled if one of them is updated from one build to another.
//  Don't add frequently updated files here; otherwise the benefits offered in terms of performance will be lost.
