// Abstract:
// - A precompiled header file
//
// - The files listed below are compiled only once, which improves performance for subsequent compilations.
// - This setting also affects the performance of IntelliSense, including code completion and many other code browsing features.
// - However, the files listed here are ALL recompiled if one of them is updated from one build to another.
// - Don't add frequently updated files here; otherwise the benefits offered in terms of performance will be lost.

// aggiungere qui le intestazioni da precompilare
