Feature request:  Added a sort option that will remove the sorting based on files and folders.  By
having this option, the names will be sorted in alphanumerical disregarding the type of file it is.
In other words, folders and files will be sorted together.

Added a toolbar button that empties the recycle bin. Currently the button works in the same way the delete button does in that
it is only accessable if you have a file or folder selected. Application should be updated to make it usable when in the recycle bin tab.
The symbol should also be changed.
